== Who Follows Who

This is a simple Rails 3.1 starter kit.

It uses these gems:

rails 3.0.10
slim
haml
webrat
rspec-rails
cucumber-rails
ruby-debug19

Most of my Rails projects have these gems.

Also I used bundle package to place all the gems in vendor/cache which speeds deployment.

Currently, this Rails app is deployed here:

http://wfw.heroku.com
